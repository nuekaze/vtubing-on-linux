# Model tracking

The most fundamental thing for a VTuber is the model and its tracking.

## VSeeFace

VSeeFace is a Unity program and one of the most common trackers. While it is not able to run natively on Linux it can be run using Wine or Proton. A lot of features like built in tracking and LeapMotion support is not available and requires workarounds. Tracking can be done using standalone OpenSeeFace tracking, iPhone or Android tracking.
